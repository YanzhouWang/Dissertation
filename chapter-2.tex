\section{Image-guided Needle Positioning Robots}
\label{sec:image_guided_needle_positioning_robots}

(list medical robots for positioning needles under imaging guidance. Main theme: positioning can be easily automated, but insertion is not)

\section{Models for Needle Insertion}
\label{sec:models_for_needle_insertion}

(list kinematic and mechanic models for needle insertion. Main theme: kinematic -> easy to formulate, but limited in usage; mechanic: generic, but difficult to formulate and simulate)

\section{Methods for Needle Control and Feedback}
\label{sec:methods_for_needle_control_and_Feedback}

(kinematic: a lot of attention due to its simplicity; mechanics: model reduction, or Jacobian (binary?)) (feedback: imaging, EM, FBG)
