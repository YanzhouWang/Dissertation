  abstract = {Lumbar injection is an image-guided procedure performed manually for diagnosis and treatment of lower back pain and leg pain. Previously, we have developed and verified an MR-Conditional robotic solution to assisting the needle insertion process. Drawing on our clinical experiences, a virtual remote center of motion (RCM) constraint is implemented to enable our robot to mimic a clinician's hand motion to adjust the needle tip position in situ. Force and image data are collected to study the needle behavior in gel phantoms during this motion, and a mechanics-based needle-tissue interaction model is proposed and evaluated to further examine the underlying physics. This work extends the commonly-adopted notion of an RCM for flexible needles, and introduces new motion parameters to describe the needle behavior. The model parameters can be tuned to match the experimental result to sub-millimeter accuracy, and this proposed needle manipulation method presents a safer alternative to laterally translating the needle during in situ needle adjustments.},

  abstract = {Study Design.~ Measurement of radiation dose from C-arm fluoroscopy during a simulated intraoperative use in spine surgery. Objective.~ To investigate scatter radiation doses to specific organs of surgeons during intraoperative use of C-arm fluoroscopy in spine surgery and to provide practical intraoperative guidelines. Summary of Background Data.~ There have been studies that reported the radiation dose of C-arm fluoroscopy in various procedures. However, radiation doses to surgeons' specific organs during spine surgery have not been sufficiently examined, and the practical intraoperative radioprotective guidelines have not been suggested. Methods.~ Scatter radiation dose (air kerma rate) was measured during the use of a C-arm on an anthropomorphic chest phantom on an operating table. Then, a whole body anthropomorphic phantom was located besides the chest phantom to simulate a surgeon, and scatter radiation doses to specific organs (eye, thyroid, breast, and gonads) and direct radiation dose to the surgeon's hand were measured using 4 C-arm configurations (standard, inverted, translateral, and tube translateral). The effects of rotating the surgeon's head away from the patient and of a thyroid shield were also evaluated. Results.~ Scatter radiation doses decreased as distance from the patient increased during C-arm fluoroscopy use. The standard and translateral C-arm configurations caused lower scatter doses to sensitive organs than inverted and tube translateral configurations. Scatter doses were highest for breast and lowest for gonads. The use of a thyroid shield and rotating the surgeon's head away from the patient reduced scatter radiation dose to the surgeon's thyroid and eyes. The direct radiation dose was at least 20 times greater than scatter doses to sensitive organs. Conclusion.~ The following factors could reduce radiation exposure during intraoperative use of C-arm; (1) distance from the patient, (2) C-arm configuration, (3) radioprotective equipments, (4) rotating the surgeons' eyes away from the patient, and (5) avoiding direct exposure of surgeons' hands.},

  abstract = {Study Design.~ A cadaveric cervical spine specimen is imaged with a standard C-arm fluoroscope during a simulated procedure. Patient and surgeon exposure to radiation is estimated by placing dosimeters at various locations in 3-dimensional space. Objective.~ The purpose of this study was to evaluate radiation exposure to patient and surgeon when using C-arm fluoroscopy during a simulated cadaveric surgical procedure involving the cervical spine. Summary of the Background Data.~ The use of mobile fluoroscopy has become commonplace in orthopaedics. With the current trend towards minimal access techniques, fluoroscopy has become requisite to achieving satisfactory outcomes. Studies have shown that spine surgeons may be at elevated risk for radiation exposure compared to other orthopaedists. Exposure while using C-arm fluoroscopy for procedures involving the pelvis, as well as thoracic and lumbar spine has been documented. However, there are no equivalent studies that evaluate exposure during cervical spine imaging. Methods.~ A standard OEC 9800 C-arm was used to image a prepared cadaveric cervical spine specimen, which was suspended on an adjustable platform. Film badge dosimeters were mounted at various positions and angles to detect direct and scatter radiation. Testing was conducted in various radiation dose mapping ``scenarios.'' The configurations tested altered the proximity of the specimen and jig relative to the radiation source. We attempted to capture radiation exposure in various locations, from a best-case to a worst-case scenario, as may be realistically encountered in a procedural setting. Results.~ Potential exposure to the patient and surgeon were consistently measurable, and of concern. As the imaged specimen was positioned closer to the radiation source, exposure to the patient was markedly amplified. Exposure to the surgeon did not increase as dramatically. There was a great degree of variability in the exposure doses recorded by the peripheral dosimeters. Even dosimeters that were placed in the same plane diverged widely in their measured exposure. This highlights the influence of the shape of the imaged specimen on reflected scatter. Scatter radiation doses on both sides of the specimen were similar. Conclusion.~ Care should be taken when working on both sides of the imaged subject. Considerable radiation exposure can be encountered when working with a C-arm fluoroscope if appropriate precautions are not observed. All appropriate radiation dose--reducing measures should be strictly enforced by the supervising physician to minimize risk to the patient and the medical team.},

  abstract = {Background. Spinal intervention procedures are widely practiced. Complications are sometimes described in case reports, but the full spectrum of possible complications has not been comprehensively publicized. The fact that certain complications continue to occur suggests that practitioners may not be fully aware of the nature of possible complications and how to recognize warning signs.Objectives. To highlight the nature of potential complications of spine interventions and to assist practitioners in recognizing warning signs of impending complications so that they might be prevented.Methods. Complications described in the literature and encountered by the authors in medicolegal proceedings were identified. Illustrations of such complications were collated together with illustrations of phenomena that might have led to complications had they not been recognized and the procedure appropriately corrected or abandoned.Results. Infection is a risk common to all invasive procedures. Spinal cord injuries have occurred during cervical medial branch blocks, intra-articular injections, and radiofrequency neurotomy because operators did not obtain correct views of the target region and misdirected their needles or electrodes. Similar errors have occurred in the conduct of lumbar blocks and neurotomy. The complications of lumbar intradiscal procedures include infection, injury to a ventral ramus, and breakage of electrodes. Cervical discography, additionally, can be complicated by spinal cord injury. Cervical transforaminal injections have been complicated by injections into a reinforcing radicular artery or the vertebral artery. Lumbar transforaminal injections have been complicated by intra-arterial injections and subdural or intrathecal injections. Epidural injections can be complicated by subdural or intrathecal injections, or venous puncture resulting in a haematoma. Intra-articular injections of the lateral atlantoaxial joint and sacroiliac joint theoretically could be complicated by injury to adjacent vessels, nerves, or viscera.Discussion. Strict adherence to published guidelines provides safeguards against encountering complications. Complications are avoided by operators knowing all the relevant anatomy of the procedure and being able to recognize aberrations in the procedure as soon as they occur.},

  abstract = {Since the discovery of spinal anesthesia in 1885 by J Leonard Corning, spinal needles have been modified to simplify their use and minimize complications. Needle design variables, such as diameter, tip design and orifice location, have been altered to enable rapid flow of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) and injected medications, yet simultaneously limit dural trauma and loss of CSF. CSF loss can result in a severe postdural puncture headache (PDPH). Blunt pencil-point tip needles have been observed to cause a lower incidence of PDPH than similar sized sharp, cutting tip needles. Smaller diameter needles are also associated with a lower incidence of PDPH. A recent alteration in spinal needles is not to the needle per se, but rather the microcatheters placed through them; currently used in Europe, such catheters are again being evaluated in the USA. Further advancements in spinal needles will most likely involve some of the design elements previously altered, as well as new features not yet recognized as important at this time.},

However, the benefits cannot be readily harnessed for interventional procedures due to difficulties that surround the use of high-field (1.5T or greater) MRI.

Needle alignment accuracy of the robot under servo pneumatic control is better than 0.94 mm rms per axis. The complete system workflow has been evaluated in phantom studies with accurate visualization and targeting of five out of five 1 cm targets.

Comprehensive preclinical tests were performed. The manipulator is MR safe (ASTM F2503-13). Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) testing (IEC 60601-1-2) of the system shows that it does not conduct or radiate EM emissions. The change in the signal to noise ratio of the MRI due to the presence and motion of the robot in the scanner is below 1\%. The structural stiffness at the needle-guide is 33 N/mm. The angular accuracy and precision of the manipulator itself are 0.177{$^\circ$} and 0.077{$^\circ$}. MRI-guided targeting accuracy and precision in vitro were 1.71 mm and 0.51 mm, at an average target depth of 38 mm, with no adjustments. The system may be suitable for DIGI where 1.07 + 0.0031 {$\cdot$} d [mm] accuracy lateral to the needle (2D) or 1.59 + 0.0031 {$\cdot$} d [mm] in 3D is acceptable. The system is also multiimager compatible and could be used with other imaging modalities.},

  abstract = {MRI-guided percutaneous liver interventions have been investigated by researchers as an alternative to CT-guided procedures as it is non-invasive and provides greater soft tissue details. In practice, however, repeated needle insertion is still required to reach desired positions on trial-and-error basis. To minimize the needle attempt and procedural time, we designed a robotic needle guidance device that provides needle insertion angle guidance at skin entry using two rotational joints structured for remote-center-of-motion manipulation. To evaluate the mechanism and clinical feasibility, we fabricated a proof-of-concept prototype that can be manually operated. As preliminary design evaluation, we conducted a retrospective clinical study of 13 MRI-guided abdominal biopsies to determine if the proposed mechanism and device can provide necessary needle insertion angles in MRI-guided liver biopsy procedures. The number of needle insertion attempts per biopsy was also measured. To confirm the kinematic design of the double ring remote-center-of-motion mechanism and to identify any procedural difficulties, we conducted a phantom targeting experiment. The retrospective clinical study showed that the 80 degree insertion angle coverage of the device is sufficient for clinical cases, and an average of five needle insertion attempts per biopsy in conventional MRI-guided biopsy can be reduced by the proposed device. A phantom targeting experiment confirmed that the unique kinematic design was successfully implementation in the targeting.},

  abstract = {In surgical procedures such as brachytherapy, biopsies and drainages, how to precisely place the needle inside the body is crucial for the performance of such surgeries. In last two decades, robot-aided needle placement has gradually been a trend for better security and accuracy. However, existing successful medical robot systems leave some common drawbacks: expensive, bulky, and high operation complexity, which motivates the development of more compact, affordable, and functional robots. This paper introduces a novel robot based on a 2-CRRR-CRR parallel manipulator (PM) for single needle insertion with high accuracy, where C denotes a cylindrical joint and R a revolute joint. Via screw theory, the mobility of the robot is analyzed, which meets the requirement of remote-center-of-motion (RCM). Its kinematic analysis is presented and singular configurations are identified based on the Jacobian matrix. Furthermore, the link dimensions of the robot are optimized by considering motion/force transmissibility and practical limits to generate singularity-free and high-performance workspace around the incision point. The design and feasibility of the proposed robot are validated by preliminary motion experiments with a prototype. The two advantages of the proposed robot are a singularity-free workspace with good motion/force transmissibility and high rigidity due to three fixed linear actuators in parallel architecture.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to prospectively evaluate the accuracy of an augmented reality image overlay system in MRI-guided spinal injection procedures. MATERIALS AND METHODS. An augmented reality prototype was used in conjunction with a 1.5-T MRI system. A human lumbar spine phantom was used in which 62 targets were punctured to assess the accuracy of the system. Sixty anatomic targets (facet joint, disk space, and spinal canal) were punctured to assess how the accuracy of the system translated into practice. A visualization software interface was used to compare planned needle paths and final needle locations on coregistered CT images (standard of reference). Outcome variables included entry error, angle error, depth error, target error, successful access of anatomic targets, number of needle adjustments, and time requirements. RESULTS. Accuracy assessments showed entry error of 1.6 {\textpm} 0.8 mm, angle error of 1.6{$^\circ$} {\textpm} 1.0{$^\circ$}, depth error of 0.7 {\textpm} 0.5 mm, and target error of 1.9 {\textpm} 0.9 mm. All anatomic targets (60 of 60 insertions) were successfully punctured, including all 20 facet joints, all 20 disks, and all 20 spinal canals. Four needle adjustments (6.7\%) were required. Planning of a single needle path required an average of 55 seconds. A single needle insertion required an average of 1 minute 27 seconds. CONCLUSION. The augmented reality image overlay system evaluated facilitated accurate MRI guidance for successful spinal procedures in a lumbar spine model. It exhibited potential for simplifying the current practice of MRI-guided lumbar spinal injection procedures.},

The 6-DOF robot is composed of a 4-DOF needle alignment module and a 2-DOF remotely actuated needle driver module, which together provide a fully actuated manipulator that can operate inside the scanner bore during imaging. The system minimizes the need to move the patient in and out of the scanner during a procedure, and thus may shorten the procedure time and streamline the clinical workflow. The robot is devised with a compact and lightweight structure that can be attached directly to the patient's lower back via straps. This approach minimizes the effect of patient motion by allowing the robot to move with the patient. The robot is integrated with an image-based surgical planning module. A dedicated clinical workflow is proposed for robot-assisted lower back pain injections under real-time MRI guidance. Targeting accuracy of the system was evaluated with a real-time MRI-guided phantom study, demonstrating the mean absolute errors (MAE) of the tip position to be 1.50{\textpm}0.68mm and of the needle angle to be 1.56{\textpm}0.93{$^\circ$}. An initial cadaver study was performed to validate the feasibility of the clinical workflow, indicating the maximum error of the position to be less than 1.90mm and of the angle to be less than 3.14{$^\circ$}.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a robotic system for steering under real-time fluoroscopic guidance a flexible needle in soft tissue. Given a target and possible obstacle locations, the computer calculates the flexible needle-tip trajectory that avoids the obstacle and hits the target. Using an inverse kinematics algorithm, the needle base maneuvers required for a tip to follow this trajectory are calculated, enabling a robot to perform controlled needle insertion. Assuming small displacements, the flexible needle is modeled as a linear beam supported by virtual springs, where the stiffness coefficients of the springs can vary along the needle. Using this simplified model, the forward and inverse kinematics of the needle are solved analytically, enabling both path planning and path correction in real time. The needle shape is detected in real time from fluoroscopic images, and the controller commands the needle base motion that minimizes the needle tip error. This approach was verified experimentally using a robot to maneuver the base of a flexible needle inserted into a muscle tissue. Along the 40-mm trajectory that avoids the obstacle and hits the target, the error stayed below the 0.5-mm level. This study demonstrates the ability to perform closed-loop control and steering of a flexible needle by maneuvering the needle base so that its tip achieves a planned trajectory.},

  abstract = {In prostate brachytherapy, radioactive seeds are implanted into the prostate for treatment of early-stage localized cancer. A major issue is seed displacement due to needle deflection, which is difficult to control as the needle is inserted manually. To address the problem and automate needle insertion, robotic systems, mathematical models for estimation and prediction and control algorithms have been developed. The method of choice for robotic steering of beveled-tip needles is predominantly intermittent axial needle rotation since this re-aligns the beveled tip and thus re-directs the needle. In this work, we present a method for needle steering to supplement axial needle rotation. A point force applied laterally to the needle near its point of insertion into tissue is used to displace the needle perpendicularly relative to its insertion axis. An advantage of this method is that the lateral force provides a continuous control input and thus continuous deflection control as opposed to axial needle rotation by 180 degrees in the 2D case of planar needle steering. Further, more control over deflection is possible as the lateral force provides direct shape change for the needle and improves the under-actuated nature of the needle. In order to predict and estimate needle deflection during insertion while applying both lateral force and axial rotation, a mechanics- and energy-based model for needle deflection is developed. Both single-layer and multi-layer tissue can be modeled if the tissue layer thickness is known. The accuracy of the model is validated experimentally. A comparison between the measured tip deflection and the model-based estimate shows only a small error. Moreover, control and sensitivity studies are carried out through insertion simulations using the model. The studies show the potentials and limitations for needle deflection reduction with various combinations of lateral force application and intermittent 180 degrees axial needle rotation.},

To better predict the radial stress and damage during needle insertions, this study was aimed to determine the friction coefficient between the material of commercial catheters and hydrogels. The friction coefficient, the tissue damage and the radial stress were evaluated at 0.2, 1.8, and 10mm/s velocities for 28, 30, and 32 gauge needles of outer diameters equal to 0.36, 0.31, and 0.23mm, respectively. Force measurements during needle insertions and retractions on agarose gel samples were used to analyze damage and radial stress. The static friction coefficient (0.295{\textpm}0.056) was significantly higher than the dynamic (0.255{\textpm}0.086). The static and dynamic friction coefficients were significantly smaller for the 0.2mm/s velocity compared to those for the other two velocities, and there was no significant difference between the friction coefficients for 1.8 and 10mm/s. Radial stress averages were 131.2{\textpm}54.1, 248.3{\textpm}64.2, and 804.9{\textpm}164.3Pa for the insertion velocity of 0.2, 1.8, and 10mm/s, respectively. The radial stress presented a tendency to increase at higher insertion velocities and needle size, which is consistent with other studies. However, the damage work did not show to be a good predictor of tissue damage, which appears to be due to simplifications in the analytical model. Differently to other approaches, the method proposed here based on radial stress may be extended in future studies to quantity tissue damage in vivo along the entire needle track.},

Results: Targeting experiments performed on both plastisol lumbar phantoms as well as an ex vivo porcine lumbar section achieved in-plane tip errors of 0.6{\textpm}0.3mm and 1.6{\textpm}0.9mm, and total tip errors of 0.9{\textpm}0.7mm and 2.1{\textpm}0.8mm for the two testing environments. Significance: Our clinically inspired control strategy and workflow is self-contained and not dependent on the modality of imaging guidance. The generalizability of the proposed approach can be applied to other needle-based interventions where medical imaging cannot be reliably utilized as part of a closed-loop control system for needle guidance.},

  abstract = {The mechanical properties of soft tissues play a key role in studying human injuries and their mitigation strategies. While such properties are indispensable for computational modelling of biological systems, they serve as important references in loading and failure experiments, and also for the development of tissue simulants. To date, experimental studies have measured the mechanical properties of peripheral tissues (e.g. skin) in-vivo and limited internal tissues ex-vivo in cadavers (e.g. brain and the heart). The lack of knowledge on a majority of human tissues inhibit their study for applications ranging from surgical planning, ballistic testing, implantable medical device development, and the assessment of traumatic injuries. The purpose of this work is to overcome such challenges through an extensive review of the literature reporting the mechanical properties of whole-body soft tissues from head to toe. Specifically, the available linear mechanical properties of all human tissues were compiled. Non-linear biomechanical models were also introduced, and the soft human tissues characterized using such models were summarized. The literature gaps identified from this work will help future biomechanical studies on soft human tissue characterization and the development of accurate medical models for the study and mitigation of injuries.},

However, high-precision numerical results cannot be achieved without reliable strain energy functions (SEFs) of the rubber or rubber nanocomposite material. Although hyperelastic constitutive models have been studied for nearly 80 years, selecting one that accurately describes rubber's mechanical response is still a challenge. This work reviews 85 isotropic SEFs based on both the phenomenological theory and the micromechanical network theory proposed from the 1940s to 2019. A fitting algorithm which can realize the automatic fitting optimization and determination of the parameters of all SEFs reviewed is developed. The ability of each SEF to reproduce the experimental data of both the unfilled and highly filled rubber nanocomposite is quantitatively assessed based on a new proposed evaluation index. The top 30 SEFs for the unfilled rubber and the top 14 SEFs for the highly filled rubber nanocomposite are presented in the ranking lists. Finally, some suggestions on how to select an appropriate hyperelastic constitutive model are given, and the perspective on the future progress of constitutive models is summarized.},

For example, the understanding of soft tissue mechanics, because of the nonlinear behaviour commonly displayed by the mechanical properties of such materials, makes common place the use of hyperelastic constitutive models. Hyperelastic models however, depend on sets of variables that must be obtained experimentally. In this study the authors use a computational/experimental scheme, for the study of the nonlinear mechanical behaviour of biological soft tissues under uniaxial tension. The material constants for seven different hyperelastic material models are obtained via inverse methods. The use of Martins's model to fit experimental data is presented in this paper for the first time. The search for an optimal value for each set of material parameters is performed by a Levenberg--Marquardt algorithm. As a control measure, the process is fully applied to silicone-rubber samples subjected to uniaxial tension tests. The fitting accuracy of the experimental stress--strain relation to the theoretical one, for both soft tissues and silicone-rubber (typically nonlinear) is evaluated. This study intents also to select which material models (or model types), the authors will employ in future works, for the analysis of human soft biological tissues.},

The present study aims to investigate the compressive properties of skeletal muscles due to different species, loading rates and fiber orientations, in order to obtain available parameters of specific material laws as references for building or improving the human body model concerning both modeling accuracy and computational cost. A series of compressive experiments of skeletal muscles were implemented for human gastrocnemius muscle, bovine and porcine hind leg muscle. To avoid long-time preservation effects, all experimental tests were carried out in 24~h after that the samples were harvested. Considering computational cost and generally used in the previous human body models, one-order hyperelastic Ogden model and three-term simplified viscoelastic quasi-linear viscoelastic (QLV) were selected for numerical analysis. Inverse finite element analysis was employed to obtain corresponding material parameters. With good fitting records, the simulation results presented available material parameters for human body model establishment, and also indicated significant differences of muscle compressive properties due to species, loading rates and fiber orientations. When considering one-order Ogden law, it is worthy of noting that the inversed material parameters of the porcine muscles are similar to those of the human gastrocnemius regardless of fiber orientations. In conclusion, the obtained material parameters in the present study can be references for global human body and body segment modeling.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces a new approach for the control of a robotic system interacting with deformable structures. The method is applied to needle insertion procedures, which are among the least invasive surgical approaches to access deep internal structures with sometimes poor access conditions. Yet, during the insertion both tissues and needles deform resulting in a displacement of targets identified at the planning step and significantly raising the technical difficulty of these approaches. Robotic assistance may offer new possibilities to enforce the accuracy of the needle's positioning, but the deformation of tissues remains an open problem. In this paper, we propose a numerical approach where finite-element (FE) models are used in a close-control robotic loop. We introduce a complete forward simulation of deformable structures (needle and environment) and constraint-based interaction models allowing for the simulation of needle insertion and complex nonlinear phenomena (friction, puncture, and insertion) at a high frequency. For the control, we numerically derive the so-called Jacobian of the Simulation using an inverse method. The most original aspect of this paper lies in the fact that inverse steps are performed in constraints space, allowing this way for fast estimation of the Jacobian (i.e., between 40 and 100 Hz). The method is validated both numerically and experimentally using a flexible needle inserted inside a deformable foam. We show that the robot is able to follow a given trajectory, defined during the planning step, taking into account any occurring deformation of both the needle and the foam during the insertion; without any need for tracking the needle neither the target nor the trajectory.},

The only requirement of the proposed method is a background mesh, which is not necessarily conforming to the boundaries/interfaces of the simulated object. The details of the surface, which can be directly obtained from binary images, are taken into account by a multilevel embedding algorithm which is applied to elements of the background mesh that are cut by the surface. Dirichlet boundary conditions can be implicitly imposed on the surface using Lagrange multipliers, whereas traction or Neumann boundary conditions, which is/are applied on parts of the surface, can be distributed to the background nodes using shape functions. The implementation is verified by convergences studies, of the geometry and of numerical solutions, which exhibit optimal rates. To verify the reliability of the method, it is applied to various needle insertion simulations (e.g. for biopsy or brachytherapy) into brain and liver models. The numerical results show that, while retaining the accuracy of the standard FEM, the proposed method can (1) make the discretisation independent from geometric description, (2) avoid the complexity of mesh generation for complex geometries, and (3) provide computational speed suitable for real-time simulations. Thereby, the proposed method is very suitable for patient-specific simulations as it improves the simulation accuracy by automatically, and properly, taking the simulated geometry into account, while keeping the low computational cost.},

  abstract = {Penetration of a flexible and steerable needle into a soft target material is a complex problem to be modelled, involving several mechanical challenges. In the present paper, an adaptive finite element algorithm is developed to simulate the penetration of a steerable needle in brain-like gelatine material, where the penetration path is not predetermined. The geometry of the needle tip induces asymmetric tractions along the tool--substrate frictional interfaces, generating a bending action on the needle in addition to combined normal and shear loading in the region where fracture takes place during penetration. The fracture process is described by a cohesive zone model, and the direction of crack propagation is determined by the distribution of strain energy density in the tissue surrounding the tip. Simulation results of deep needle penetration for a programmable bevel-tip needle design, where steering can be controlled by changing the offset between interlocked needle segments, are mainly discussed in terms of penetration force versus displacement along with a detailed description of the needle tip trajectories. It is shown that such results are strongly dependent on the relative stiffness of needle and tissue and on the tip offset. The simulated relationship between programmable bevel offset and needle curvature is found to be approximately linear, confirming empirical results derived experimentally in a previous work. The proposed model enables a detailed analysis of the tool--tissue interactions during needle penetration, providing a reliable means to optimise the design of surgical catheters and aid pre-operative planning.},

These advantages enable their broad applications with minimal trauma and make challenging clinical procedures possible with miniaturized instrumentation and high curvilinear access capabilities. However, their inherent deformable designs make it difficult to realize 3-D intraoperative real-time shape sensing to accurately model their shape. Solutions to this limitation can lead themselves to further develop closely associated techniques of closed-loop control, path planning, human-robot interaction, and surgical manipulation safety concerns in minimally invasive surgery. Although extensive model-based research that relies on kinematics and mechanics has been performed, accurate shape sensing of continuum robots remains challenging, particularly in cases of unknown and dynamic payloads. This survey investigates the recent advances in alternative emerging techniques for 3-D shape sensing in this field and focuses on the following categories: fiber-optic-sensor-based, electromagnetic-tracking-based, and intraoperative imaging modality-based shape-reconstruction methods.

FBG strain sensors offer the advantages of optical fibre sensors, such as high sensitivity, immunity to electromagnetic noise, electrical passivity and chemical inertness, but are not limited by phase discontinuity or intensity fluctuations. FBG sensors feature a wavelength-encoding sensing signal that enables distributed sensing that utilises fewer connections. In addition, their flexibility and lightness allow easy insertion into needles and catheters, thus enabling localised measurements inside tissues and blood. Two types of FBG tactile sensors have been emphasised in the literature: single-point and array FBG tactile sensors. This paper describes the current design, development and research of the optical fibre tactile techniques that are based on FBGs to enhance the performance of MIS procedures in general. Providing MIS or microsurgery surgeons with accurate and precise measurements and control of the contact forces during tissues manipulation will benefit both surgeons and patients.},

There are several technological solutions to design MR-compatible sensors, among them, the one based on optical fibers presents several attractive features. The high elasticity and small size allow designing miniaturized fiber optic sensors (FOS) with metrological characteristics (e.g., accuracy, sensitivity, zero drift, and frequency response) adequate for most common medical applications; the immunity from electromagnetic interference and the absence of electrical connection to the patient make FOS suitable to be used in high electromagnetic field and intrinsically safer than conventional technologies. These two features further heightened the potential role of FOS in medicine making them especially attractive for application in MRI. This paper provides an overview of MR-compatible FOS, focusing on the sensors employed for measuring physical parameters in medicine (i.e., temperature, force, torque, strain, and position). The working principles of the most promising FOS are reviewed in terms of their relevant advantages and disadvantages, together with their applications in medicine.},

  abstract = {We describe a MRI-compatible biopsy needle instrumented with optical fiber Bragg gratings for measuring bending deflections of the needle as it is inserted into tissues. During procedures, such as diagnostic biopsies and localized treatments, it is useful to track any tool deviation from the planned trajectory to minimize positioning errors and procedural complications. The goal is to display tool deflections in real time, with greater bandwidth and accuracy than when viewing the tool in MR images. A standard 18 ga {\texttimes} 15 cm inner needle is prepared using a fixture, and 350-{$\mu$}m-deep grooves are created along its length. Optical fibers are embedded in the grooves. Two sets of sensors, located at different points along the needle, provide an estimate of the bent profile, as well as temperature compensation. Tests of the needle in a water bath showed that it produced no adverse imaging artifacts when used with the MR scanner.},

Three fibers, each with three Fiber Bragg Gratings (FBG) were embedded into a 0.6 mm inner stylet of a 20G MRI-compatible biopsy needle. The axial force caused by the bevel-tip was considered in the analysis using beam-column theory. Since the insertion depth is varying, the minimum number of sensors and their optimal locations in the fibers were determined such that the tip position error estimation is below 0.5 mm for all insertion depths. A practical and accurate calibration method for the apparatus is presented. The instrumented needle was fabricated to fit in the needle driver unit of a MRI-compatible needle steering robot. The tracking apparatus was calibrated, including compensation for temperature changes in tissue during insertion. Experimental results showed needle tip tracking error below 0.5 mm at different insertion depths.

In this paper, we develop a three-dimensional (3D) closed-loop control algorithm to robotically steer flexible needles with an asymmetric tip towards a target in a soft-tissue phantom. Twelve Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensors are embedded on the needle shaft. FBG sensors measure the strain applied on the needle during insertion. A method is developed to reconstruct the needle shape using the strain data obtained from the FBG sensors. Four experimental cases are conducted to validate the reconstruction method (single-bend, double-bend, 3D double-bend and drilling insertions). In the experiments, the needle is inserted 120 mm into a soft-tissue phantom. Camera images are used as a reference for the reconstruction experiments. The results show that the mean needle tip accuracy of the reconstruction method is 1.8 mm. The reconstructed needle shape is used as feedback for the steering algorithm. The steering algorithm estimates the region that the needle can reach during insertion, and controls the needle to keep the target in this region. Steering experiments are performed for 110 mm insertion, and the mean targeting accuracy is 1.3 mm. The results demonstrate the capability of using FBG sensors to robotically steer needles.},

We also describe kinematics-based and mechanics-based models for predicting the 3-D needle shape during insertion into soft tissue. We perform experiments where the needle is inserted into a soft-tissue simulant, and the 3-D needle shape is reconstructed using the FBG sensors. We compare the reconstructed needle shape to deflection obtained from camera images and our models. The maximum error between the experiments and the camera images is 0.74 mm. The maximum errors between the kinematics-based and mechanics-based models and the camera images are 3.77 mm and 2.20 mm, respectively.

This is especially critical when considering conventional surgery procedures where a surgeon usually determines how to proceed needle insertion further based on the current needle trajectory inserted into tissue during biopsy and removal of malignant tissues in the body. In this paper, we propose a new method to determine the shape of a needle that is being inserted, together with the curvature measurement data obtained by fiber Bragg gratings (FBG) sensors inside the needle. This approach can be particularly advantageous to the situations where visual guidance (such as by ultrasound probes) is not easily applicable. The description of a needle shape is based on the elastic rod theory and Lie-group-theoretic approach. We also present the comparison between two different calibration methods, which have an impact on the quality of the results of the proposed method. In order to verify the proposed method, needle trajectories by the model are compared with experimental data obtained by image analysis, which in turn emphasizes the capability of the proposed method.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an algorithm for controlling the error in non-linear finite element analysis which is caused by the use of finite load steps. In contrast to most recent schemes, the proposed technique is non-iterative and treats the governing load--deflection relations as a system of ordinary differential equations. This permits the governing equations to be integrated adaptively where the step size is controlled by monitoring the local truncation error. The latter is measured by computing the difference between two estimates of the displacement increments for each load step, with the initial estimate being found from the first-order Euler scheme and the improved estimate being found from the second-order modified Euler scheme. If the local truncation error exceeds a specified tolerance, then the load step is abandoned and the integration is repeated with a smaller load step whose size is found by local extrapolation. Local extrapolation is also used to predict the size of the next load step following a successful update. In order to control not only the local load path error, but also the global load path error, the proposed scheme incorporates a correction for the unbalanced forces. Overall, the cost of the automatic error control is modest since it requires only one additional equation solution for each successful load step. Because the solution scheme is non-iterative and founded on successful techniques for integrating systems of ordinary differential equations, it is particularly robust. To illustrate the ability of the scheme to constrain the load path error to lie near a desired tolerance, detailed results are presented for a variety of elastoplastic boundary value problems.},

Similarly, these factors are shown to have a pronounced effect on the efficiency and stability of some classical iterative schemes.

  abstract = {Needles are tools that are used daily during minimally invasive procedures. During the insertions, needles may be affected by deformations which may threaten the success of the procedure. To tackle this problem, needles with embedded strain sensors have been developed and associated with navigation systems. The localization of the needle in the tissues is then obtained in real time by reconstruction from the strain measurements, allowing the physician to optimize its gesture. As the number of strain sensors embedded is limited in number, their positions on the needle have a great impact on the accuracy of the shape reconstruction. The main contribution of this paper is a novel strain sensor positioning method to improve the reconstruction accuracy. A notable feature of our method is the use of experimental needle insertion data, which increases the relevancy of the resulting sensor optimal locations. To the best of the author's knowledge, no experimentally based needle sensor positioning method has been presented yet. Reconstruction validations from clinical data show that the localization accuracy of the needle tip is improved by almost 40\% with optimal locations compared with equidistant locations when reconstructing with two sensor triplets or more.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the performance analysis of the system for real-time reconstruction of the shape of the rigid medical needle used for minimally invasive surgeries. The system is based on four optical fibers glued along the needle at 90 degrees from each other to measure distributed strain along the needle from four different sides. The distributed measurement is achieved by the interrogator which detects the light scattered from each section of the fiber connected to it and calculates the strain exposed to the fiber from the spectral shift of that backscattered light. This working principle has a limitation of discriminating only a single fiber because of the overlap of backscattering light from several fibers. In order to use four sensing fibers, the Scattering-Level Multiplexing (SLMux) methodology is applied. SLMux is based on fibers with different scattering levels: standard single-mode fibers (SMF) and MgO-nanoparticles doped fibers with a 35--40~dB higher scattering power. Doped fibers are used as sensing fibers and SMFs are used to spatially separate one sensing fiber from another by selecting appropriate lengths of SMFs. The system with four fibers allows obtaining two pairs of opposite fibers used to reconstruct the needle shape along two perpendicular axes. The performance analysis is conducted by moving the needle tip from 0 to 1~cm by 0.1~cm to four main directions (corresponding to the locations of fibers) and to four intermediate directions (between neighboring fibers). The system accuracy for small bending (0.1--0.5~cm) is 90\$\${\textbackslash}\%\$\$and for large bending (0.6--1~cm) is approximately 92\$\${\textbackslash}\%\$\$.},

The most widely used compensation methods can be classified into three types depending on the FBG encapsulation method: 1) dual-grating differential measurement for fully pasted FBGs, 2) dual-grating differential measurement for prestretched FBGs with both ends fixed, and 3) the addition of a temperature-reference FBG. In current reports, temperature compensation is performed based on the assumption that the wavelength shifts of the two FBGs are the same (or proportional to each other) and are synchronous with the temperature variation. However, because of uncertainties in workmanship and the thermal flow differences between different encapsulated FBGs, the validity of this assumption is doubtful. In this paper, the compensation characteristics of each method at different heating rates are investigated through a series of experiments and theoretical analyses. A detailed comparative analysis shows that Method 2 can be considered the optimal temperature compensation scheme in terms of both compensation accuracy and stability, whereas Method 1 is slightly inferior to Method 2. In addition, Method 3 is roughly equivalent to Method 1 and slightly inferior to Method 2 when the heating rate is \&lt;0.8 {$^\circ$}C/min; however, when the heating rate is {$\geq$}1 {$^\circ$}C/min, Method 3 is considerably inferior to both Method 1 and Method 2. The results indicate that the compensation effect is determined by both the FBG encapsulation method and the temperature change rate, thus revealing the deficiency of the current compensation assumption.},

  abstract = {Animal models in spine research are often criticized for being irrelevant to the human situation due to the horizontal position of the spine. Whether this is justified from a biomechanical point of view can be questioned. The purpose of the study reported here was to provide arguments that a quadruped can be a valuable in vivo model for the study of the spine in spite of its horizontal position. Relevant literature is reviewed, and biomechanical analyses were made of the standing and walking quadruped. Further, the vertebral trabecular bone architecture was quantitatively analysed by computer and interpreted in the light of Wolff's law. Due to the fact that spinal segments cannot withstand substantial bending moments, additional tensile forces from muscles and ligaments are necessary to control the posture of a quadruped spine. As a consequence, the spine is mainly loaded by axial compression. The trabeculae in a goat's vertebral body were found to course horizontally between its anterior and posterior endplates, implying that the main load within the vertebral body was indeed an axial compression force. The density of the vertebrae of quadrupeds is higher than that of human vertebrae, suggesting that the quadruped has to sustain higher axial compression stresses. The quadruped spine is mainly loaded along its long axis, just like the human spine. The quadruped can thus be a valuable animal model for spine research. An important point of difference is the higher axial compression stress in quadrupeds, which leads to higher bone densities in the vertebrae. This puts some limitations on the transferability of the results of animal experiments to the human situation.},

In this study we report a protocol for performing an MIS training course on a fresh porcine cadaver. We find that the porcine lumbar spine closely resembles the human spine in terms of the vertebral and discal anatomy. Notable differences include a lower disc height and shallower diameter. We obtained fresh porcine cadavers weighing 40-70 kg from local farmers that had been gutted and bled. We position the cadaver prone on a backboard and set up the operating room with biplanar fluoroscopy. During approach and cage insertion, we found that the tactile feedback obtained is realistic and allows surgeons to familiarize themselves with the procedure. Porcine cadavers were also an excellent tool for practicing pedicle screw fixation due to the larger pedicles. Five training courses involving eight surgeons noted that except for anatomical differences the training course was equivalent to training on human cadavers and unanimously preferred training on porcine cadavers to synthetic foam models. We conclude that porcine cadavers are a useful model for training surgeons in MIS surgery. Routine use of porcine cadavers may increase the availability of MIS surgery training.},

  abstract = {Image-guided spinal injection is commonly performed in symptomatic patients to decrease pain severity, confirm the pain generator, and delay or avoid surgery. This article focuses on the radiologist as spine interventionist and addresses the following four topics relevant to the radiologist who performs corticosteroid injections for pain management: (a) the rationale behind corticosteroid injection, (b) the interaction with patients, (c) the role of imaging in procedural selection and planning, and (d) the pearls and pitfalls of fluoroscopically guided injections. Factors that contribute to the success of a pain management service include communication skills and risk mitigation. A critical factor is the correlation of clinical symptoms with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging findings. Radiologists can leverage their training in MR image interpretation to distinguish active pain generators in the spine from incidental abnormalities. Knowledge of fluoroscopic anatomy and patterns of contrast material flow guide the planning and execution of safe and effective needle placement. {\copyright} RSNA, 2016 Online supplemental material is available for this article.},

  abstract = {The objective of the present study is to determine the passive transverse mechanical properties of skeletal muscle. Compression experiments were performed on four rat tibialis anterior muscles. To assess the stress- and strain-distributions in the muscle during the experiment, a plane stress model of the cross section was developed for each muscle. The incompressible viscoelastic Ogden model was used to describe the passive muscle behaviour. The four material parameters were determined by fitting calculated indentation forces on measured indentation forces. The elastic parameters, {$\mu$} and {$\alpha$}, were 15.6{\textpm}5.4kPa and 21.4{\textpm}5.7, respectively. The viscoelastic parameters, {$\delta$} and {$\tau$}, were 0.549{\textpm}0.056 and 6.01{\textpm}0.42s. When applying the estimated material parameters in a three-dimensional finite element model, the measured behaviour can be accurately simulated.},

  abstract = {Understanding passive skeletal muscle mechanics is critical in defining structure--function relationships in skeletal muscle and ultimately understanding pathologically impaired muscle. In this systematic review, we performed an exhaustive literature search using PRISMA guidelines to quantify passive muscle mechanical properties, summarized the methods used to create these data, and make recommendations to standardize future studies. We screened over 7500 papers and found 80 papers that met the inclusion criteria. These papers reported passive muscle mechanics from single muscle fiber to whole muscle across 16 species and 54 distinct muscles. We found a wide range of methodological differences in sample selection, preparation, testing, and analysis. The systematic review revealed that passive muscle mechanics is species and scale dependent---specifically within mammals, the passive mechanics increases non-linearly with scale. However, a detailed understanding of passive mechanics is still unclear because the varied methodologies impede comparisons across studies, scales, species, and muscles. Therefore, we recommend the following: smaller scales may be maintained within storage solution prior to testing, when samples are tested statically use 2--3~min of relaxation time, stress normalization at the whole muscle level be to physiologic cross-sectional area, strain normalization be to sarcomere length when possible, and an exponential equation be used to fit the data. Additional studies using these recommendations will allow exploration of the multiscale relationship of passive force within and across species to provide the fundamental knowledge needed to improve our understanding of passive muscle mechanics.},

  abstract = {The goal of this study was to characterize the passive elastic behaviour of muscle and tendon tissues of rat tibialis anterior. For that purpose, tissue samples from 3 month old female Wistar rats (210{\textpm}11g) were mechanically tested in vitro. Moreover, an in vivo device was developed to measure the muscle--tendon unit response to increasing load. Mechanical tests, consisting of uniaxial loading along the longitudinal axis of tendon and muscle strips, revealed the nonlinear mechanical behaviour of these tissues. A material model was formulated and its parameters fit to the experimental data using the Levenberg--Marquardt optimization algorithm. The fit goodness was assessed and R2 values close to 1 and very low {$\varepsilon$} values were obtained. The passive behaviour of a future finite element model of a muscle--tendon unit will be validated against the in vivo passive extension tests by comparing the reaction force--extension curves.},
