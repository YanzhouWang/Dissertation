  abstract = {Lumbar injection is an image-guided procedure performed manually for diagnosis and treatment of lower back pain and leg pain. Previously, we have developed and verified an MR-Conditional robotic solution to assisting the needle insertion process. Drawing on our clinical experiences, a virtual remote center of motion (RCM) constraint is implemented to enable our robot to mimic a clinician's hand motion to adjust the needle tip position in situ. Force and image data are collected to study the needle behavior in gel phantoms during this motion, and a mechanics-based needle-tissue interaction model is proposed and evaluated to further examine the underlying physics. This work extends the commonly-adopted notion of an RCM for flexible needles, and introduces new motion parameters to describe the needle behavior. The model parameters can be tuned to match the experimental result to sub-millimeter accuracy, and this proposed needle manipulation method presents a safer alternative to laterally translating the needle during in situ needle adjustments.},

  abstract = {Study Design.~ Measurement of radiation dose from C-arm fluoroscopy during a simulated intraoperative use in spine surgery. Objective.~ To investigate scatter radiation doses to specific organs of surgeons during intraoperative use of C-arm fluoroscopy in spine surgery and to provide practical intraoperative guidelines. Summary of Background Data.~ There have been studies that reported the radiation dose of C-arm fluoroscopy in various procedures. However, radiation doses to surgeons' specific organs during spine surgery have not been sufficiently examined, and the practical intraoperative radioprotective guidelines have not been suggested. Methods.~ Scatter radiation dose (air kerma rate) was measured during the use of a C-arm on an anthropomorphic chest phantom on an operating table. Then, a whole body anthropomorphic phantom was located besides the chest phantom to simulate a surgeon, and scatter radiation doses to specific organs (eye, thyroid, breast, and gonads) and direct radiation dose to the surgeon's hand were measured using 4 C-arm configurations (standard, inverted, translateral, and tube translateral). The effects of rotating the surgeon's head away from the patient and of a thyroid shield were also evaluated. Results.~ Scatter radiation doses decreased as distance from the patient increased during C-arm fluoroscopy use. The standard and translateral C-arm configurations caused lower scatter doses to sensitive organs than inverted and tube translateral configurations. Scatter doses were highest for breast and lowest for gonads. The use of a thyroid shield and rotating the surgeon's head away from the patient reduced scatter radiation dose to the surgeon's thyroid and eyes. The direct radiation dose was at least 20 times greater than scatter doses to sensitive organs. Conclusion.~ The following factors could reduce radiation exposure during intraoperative use of C-arm; (1) distance from the patient, (2) C-arm configuration, (3) radioprotective equipments, (4) rotating the surgeons' eyes away from the patient, and (5) avoiding direct exposure of surgeons' hands.},

  abstract = {Study Design.~ A cadaveric cervical spine specimen is imaged with a standard C-arm fluoroscope during a simulated procedure. Patient and surgeon exposure to radiation is estimated by placing dosimeters at various locations in 3-dimensional space. Objective.~ The purpose of this study was to evaluate radiation exposure to patient and surgeon when using C-arm fluoroscopy during a simulated cadaveric surgical procedure involving the cervical spine. Summary of the Background Data.~ The use of mobile fluoroscopy has become commonplace in orthopaedics. With the current trend towards minimal access techniques, fluoroscopy has become requisite to achieving satisfactory outcomes. Studies have shown that spine surgeons may be at elevated risk for radiation exposure compared to other orthopaedists. Exposure while using C-arm fluoroscopy for procedures involving the pelvis, as well as thoracic and lumbar spine has been documented. However, there are no equivalent studies that evaluate exposure during cervical spine imaging. Methods.~ A standard OEC 9800 C-arm was used to image a prepared cadaveric cervical spine specimen, which was suspended on an adjustable platform. Film badge dosimeters were mounted at various positions and angles to detect direct and scatter radiation. Testing was conducted in various radiation dose mapping ``scenarios.'' The configurations tested altered the proximity of the specimen and jig relative to the radiation source. We attempted to capture radiation exposure in various locations, from a best-case to a worst-case scenario, as may be realistically encountered in a procedural setting. Results.~ Potential exposure to the patient and surgeon were consistently measurable, and of concern. As the imaged specimen was positioned closer to the radiation source, exposure to the patient was markedly amplified. Exposure to the surgeon did not increase as dramatically. There was a great degree of variability in the exposure doses recorded by the peripheral dosimeters. Even dosimeters that were placed in the same plane diverged widely in their measured exposure. This highlights the influence of the shape of the imaged specimen on reflected scatter. Scatter radiation doses on both sides of the specimen were similar. Conclusion.~ Care should be taken when working on both sides of the imaged subject. Considerable radiation exposure can be encountered when working with a C-arm fluoroscope if appropriate precautions are not observed. All appropriate radiation dose--reducing measures should be strictly enforced by the supervising physician to minimize risk to the patient and the medical team.},

  abstract = {Background. Spinal intervention procedures are widely practiced. Complications are sometimes described in case reports, but the full spectrum of possible complications has not been comprehensively publicized. The fact that certain complications continue to occur suggests that practitioners may not be fully aware of the nature of possible complications and how to recognize warning signs.Objectives. To highlight the nature of potential complications of spine interventions and to assist practitioners in recognizing warning signs of impending complications so that they might be prevented.Methods. Complications described in the literature and encountered by the authors in medicolegal proceedings were identified. Illustrations of such complications were collated together with illustrations of phenomena that might have led to complications had they not been recognized and the procedure appropriately corrected or abandoned.Results. Infection is a risk common to all invasive procedures. Spinal cord injuries have occurred during cervical medial branch blocks, intra-articular injections, and radiofrequency neurotomy because operators did not obtain correct views of the target region and misdirected their needles or electrodes. Similar errors have occurred in the conduct of lumbar blocks and neurotomy. The complications of lumbar intradiscal procedures include infection, injury to a ventral ramus, and breakage of electrodes. Cervical discography, additionally, can be complicated by spinal cord injury. Cervical transforaminal injections have been complicated by injections into a reinforcing radicular artery or the vertebral artery. Lumbar transforaminal injections have been complicated by intra-arterial injections and subdural or intrathecal injections. Epidural injections can be complicated by subdural or intrathecal injections, or venous puncture resulting in a haematoma. Intra-articular injections of the lateral atlantoaxial joint and sacroiliac joint theoretically could be complicated by injury to adjacent vessels, nerves, or viscera.Discussion. Strict adherence to published guidelines provides safeguards against encountering complications. Complications are avoided by operators knowing all the relevant anatomy of the procedure and being able to recognize aberrations in the procedure as soon as they occur.},

  abstract = {Since the discovery of spinal anesthesia in 1885 by J Leonard Corning, spinal needles have been modified to simplify their use and minimize complications. Needle design variables, such as diameter, tip design and orifice location, have been altered to enable rapid flow of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) and injected medications, yet simultaneously limit dural trauma and loss of CSF. CSF loss can result in a severe postdural puncture headache (PDPH). Blunt pencil-point tip needles have been observed to cause a lower incidence of PDPH than similar sized sharp, cutting tip needles. Smaller diameter needles are also associated with a lower incidence of PDPH. A recent alteration in spinal needles is not to the needle per se, but rather the microcatheters placed through them; currently used in Europe, such catheters are again being evaluated in the USA. Further advancements in spinal needles will most likely involve some of the design elements previously altered, as well as new features not yet recognized as important at this time.},

However, the benefits cannot be readily harnessed for interventional procedures due to difficulties that surround the use of high-field (1.5T or greater) MRI.

Needle alignment accuracy of the robot under servo pneumatic control is better than 0.94 mm rms per axis. The complete system workflow has been evaluated in phantom studies with accurate visualization and targeting of five out of five 1 cm targets.

Comprehensive preclinical tests were performed. The manipulator is MR safe (ASTM F2503-13). Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) testing (IEC 60601-1-2) of the system shows that it does not conduct or radiate EM emissions. The change in the signal to noise ratio of the MRI due to the presence and motion of the robot in the scanner is below 1\%. The structural stiffness at the needle-guide is 33 N/mm. The angular accuracy and precision of the manipulator itself are 0.177{$^\circ$} and 0.077{$^\circ$}. MRI-guided targeting accuracy and precision in vitro were 1.71 mm and 0.51 mm, at an average target depth of 38 mm, with no adjustments. The system may be suitable for DIGI where 1.07 + 0.0031 {$\cdot$} d [mm] accuracy lateral to the needle (2D) or 1.59 + 0.0031 {$\cdot$} d [mm] in 3D is acceptable. The system is also multiimager compatible and could be used with other imaging modalities.},

  abstract = {MRI-guided percutaneous liver interventions have been investigated by researchers as an alternative to CT-guided procedures as it is non-invasive and provides greater soft tissue details. In practice, however, repeated needle insertion is still required to reach desired positions on trial-and-error basis. To minimize the needle attempt and procedural time, we designed a robotic needle guidance device that provides needle insertion angle guidance at skin entry using two rotational joints structured for remote-center-of-motion manipulation. To evaluate the mechanism and clinical feasibility, we fabricated a proof-of-concept prototype that can be manually operated. As preliminary design evaluation, we conducted a retrospective clinical study of 13 MRI-guided abdominal biopsies to determine if the proposed mechanism and device can provide necessary needle insertion angles in MRI-guided liver biopsy procedures. The number of needle insertion attempts per biopsy was also measured. To confirm the kinematic design of the double ring remote-center-of-motion mechanism and to identify any procedural difficulties, we conducted a phantom targeting experiment. The retrospective clinical study showed that the 80 degree insertion angle coverage of the device is sufficient for clinical cases, and an average of five needle insertion attempts per biopsy in conventional MRI-guided biopsy can be reduced by the proposed device. A phantom targeting experiment confirmed that the unique kinematic design was successfully implementation in the targeting.},

Therefore, this paper is devoted to reviewing the development of robotics from the perspective of kinematics in MIS during the past twenty years taking account of the kinematic structures of the manipulator design of the robots.

  abstract = {In surgical procedures such as brachytherapy, biopsies and drainages, how to precisely place the needle inside the body is crucial for the performance of such surgeries. In last two decades, robot-aided needle placement has gradually been a trend for better security and accuracy. However, existing successful medical robot systems leave some common drawbacks: expensive, bulky, and high operation complexity, which motivates the development of more compact, affordable, and functional robots. This paper introduces a novel robot based on a 2-CRRR-CRR parallel manipulator (PM) for single needle insertion with high accuracy, where C denotes a cylindrical joint and R a revolute joint. Via screw theory, the mobility of the robot is analyzed, which meets the requirement of remote-center-of-motion (RCM). Its kinematic analysis is presented and singular configurations are identified based on the Jacobian matrix. Furthermore, the link dimensions of the robot are optimized by considering motion/force transmissibility and practical limits to generate singularity-free and high-performance workspace around the incision point. The design and feasibility of the proposed robot are validated by preliminary motion experiments with a prototype. The two advantages of the proposed robot are a singularity-free workspace with good motion/force transmissibility and high rigidity due to three fixed linear actuators in parallel architecture.},

The open-loop positioning accuracy of the slider and rotor is within {\textbackslash}pm1 mm and from -0.8\textsuperscript{{\textbackslash}circ } to 1.5\textsuperscript{{\textbackslash}circ }, respectively. The trajectory tracking error of the system is within 1.71 mm. The stiffness of the positioner in the x- and y-directions can be calculated as 9.03 and 11.91 N/mm, respectively.

The key features of the manipulator such as backdrivable joints, a fault-tolerant needle driver, stationary actuators, and redundant sensors enhance overall safety and reliability of the mechanism, a critical requirement for surgical manipulators.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to prospectively evaluate the accuracy of an augmented reality image overlay system in MRI-guided spinal injection procedures. MATERIALS AND METHODS. An augmented reality prototype was used in conjunction with a 1.5-T MRI system. A human lumbar spine phantom was used in which 62 targets were punctured to assess the accuracy of the system. Sixty anatomic targets (facet joint, disk space, and spinal canal) were punctured to assess how the accuracy of the system translated into practice. A visualization software interface was used to compare planned needle paths and final needle locations on coregistered CT images (standard of reference). Outcome variables included entry error, angle error, depth error, target error, successful access of anatomic targets, number of needle adjustments, and time requirements. RESULTS. Accuracy assessments showed entry error of 1.6 {\textpm} 0.8 mm, angle error of 1.6{$^\circ$} {\textpm} 1.0{$^\circ$}, depth error of 0.7 {\textpm} 0.5 mm, and target error of 1.9 {\textpm} 0.9 mm. All anatomic targets (60 of 60 insertions) were successfully punctured, including all 20 facet joints, all 20 disks, and all 20 spinal canals. Four needle adjustments (6.7\%) were required. Planning of a single needle path required an average of 55 seconds. A single needle insertion required an average of 1 minute 27 seconds. CONCLUSION. The augmented reality image overlay system evaluated facilitated accurate MRI guidance for successful spinal procedures in a lumbar spine model. It exhibited potential for simplifying the current practice of MRI-guided lumbar spinal injection procedures.},

The 6-DOF robot is composed of a 4-DOF needle alignment module and a 2-DOF remotely actuated needle driver module, which together provide a fully actuated manipulator that can operate inside the scanner bore during imaging. The system minimizes the need to move the patient in and out of the scanner during a procedure, and thus may shorten the procedure time and streamline the clinical workflow. The robot is devised with a compact and lightweight structure that can be attached directly to the patient's lower back via straps. This approach minimizes the effect of patient motion by allowing the robot to move with the patient. The robot is integrated with an image-based surgical planning module. A dedicated clinical workflow is proposed for robot-assisted lower back pain injections under real-time MRI guidance. Targeting accuracy of the system was evaluated with a real-time MRI-guided phantom study, demonstrating the mean absolute errors (MAE) of the tip position to be 1.50{\textpm}0.68mm and of the needle angle to be 1.56{\textpm}0.93{$^\circ$}. An initial cadaver study was performed to validate the feasibility of the clinical workflow, indicating the maximum error of the position to be less than 1.90mm and of the angle to be less than 3.14{$^\circ$}.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a robotic system for steering under real-time fluoroscopic guidance a flexible needle in soft tissue. Given a target and possible obstacle locations, the computer calculates the flexible needle-tip trajectory that avoids the obstacle and hits the target. Using an inverse kinematics algorithm, the needle base maneuvers required for a tip to follow this trajectory are calculated, enabling a robot to perform controlled needle insertion. Assuming small displacements, the flexible needle is modeled as a linear beam supported by virtual springs, where the stiffness coefficients of the springs can vary along the needle. Using this simplified model, the forward and inverse kinematics of the needle are solved analytically, enabling both path planning and path correction in real time. The needle shape is detected in real time from fluoroscopic images, and the controller commands the needle base motion that minimizes the needle tip error. This approach was verified experimentally using a robot to maneuver the base of a flexible needle inserted into a muscle tissue. Along the 40-mm trajectory that avoids the obstacle and hits the target, the error stayed below the 0.5-mm level. This study demonstrates the ability to perform closed-loop control and steering of a flexible needle by maneuvering the needle base so that its tip achieves a planned trajectory.},

  abstract = {In prostate brachytherapy, radioactive seeds are implanted into the prostate for treatment of early-stage localized cancer. A major issue is seed displacement due to needle deflection, which is difficult to control as the needle is inserted manually. To address the problem and automate needle insertion, robotic systems, mathematical models for estimation and prediction and control algorithms have been developed. The method of choice for robotic steering of beveled-tip needles is predominantly intermittent axial needle rotation since this re-aligns the beveled tip and thus re-directs the needle. In this work, we present a method for needle steering to supplement axial needle rotation. A point force applied laterally to the needle near its point of insertion into tissue is used to displace the needle perpendicularly relative to its insertion axis. An advantage of this method is that the lateral force provides a continuous control input and thus continuous deflection control as opposed to axial needle rotation by 180 degrees in the 2D case of planar needle steering. Further, more control over deflection is possible as the lateral force provides direct shape change for the needle and improves the under-actuated nature of the needle. In order to predict and estimate needle deflection during insertion while applying both lateral force and axial rotation, a mechanics- and energy-based model for needle deflection is developed. Both single-layer and multi-layer tissue can be modeled if the tissue layer thickness is known. The accuracy of the model is validated experimentally. A comparison between the measured tip deflection and the model-based estimate shows only a small error. Moreover, control and sensitivity studies are carried out through insertion simulations using the model. The studies show the potentials and limitations for needle deflection reduction with various combinations of lateral force application and intermittent 180 degrees axial needle rotation.},

  abstract = {Agarose hydrogels have been extensively used as a phantom material to mimic the mechanical behavior of soft biological tissues, e.g. in studies aimed to analyze needle insertions into the organs producing tissue damage. To better predict the radial stress and damage during needle insertions, this study was aimed to determine the friction coefficient between the material of commercial catheters and hydrogels. The friction coefficient, the tissue damage and the radial stress were evaluated at 0.2, 1.8, and 10mm/s velocities for 28, 30, and 32 gauge needles of outer diameters equal to 0.36, 0.31, and 0.23mm, respectively. Force measurements during needle insertions and retractions on agarose gel samples were used to analyze damage and radial stress. The static friction coefficient (0.295{\textpm}0.056) was significantly higher than the dynamic (0.255{\textpm}0.086). The static and dynamic friction coefficients were significantly smaller for the 0.2mm/s velocity compared to those for the other two velocities, and there was no significant difference between the friction coefficients for 1.8 and 10mm/s. Radial stress averages were 131.2{\textpm}54.1, 248.3{\textpm}64.2, and 804.9{\textpm}164.3Pa for the insertion velocity of 0.2, 1.8, and 10mm/s, respectively. The radial stress presented a tendency to increase at higher insertion velocities and needle size, which is consistent with other studies. However, the damage work did not show to be a good predictor of tissue damage, which appears to be due to simplifications in the analytical model. Differently to other approaches, the method proposed here based on radial stress may be extended in future studies to quantity tissue damage in vivo along the entire needle track.},
